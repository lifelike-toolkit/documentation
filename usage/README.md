# Toolkit Usage
Here lies the prophecy of the new game you are making. Follow the guidance of the script and fulfill your destiny.

# Project Structure
Integration with [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html). However, if a specific vectorstore/model you want is not provided by langchain, visit
## [Use Custom LLM](https://lifelike-toolkit.github.io/documentation/usage/llm)
## [Use Custom Vectorstore](https://lifelike-toolkit.github.io/documentation/usage/vectorstore)

Currently, the toolkit is meant to be used on a Python microservice that can communicate with the game code.

However, if your game is made in Python, you can just Lifelike directly in the game code.
